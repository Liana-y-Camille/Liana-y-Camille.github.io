Where can I stay?
-Hotel recomendations-

Airbnb's are also a goof option, San Salvador has plenty of options to suit different budgets. If you're staying at an Airbnb it can be in the areas of San Benito, Escalon or Zona Rosa to be close to the designated pick up zones. 

What will the weather be like?
March is one of the warmest months of the year. In the mountains (like the venue), nights can get a little chilly, so pack a light sweater or jacket if you’re heading up there.

What clothes should I bring?
Think light and fresh: linen shirts, shorts, dresses. Don’t forget a swimsuit if you’re planning to hit the beach, lake, or waterfalls.

How can I move around?
The easiest way is by Uber or Taxis Acacya (a reliable local taxi service).

Is it safe?
Yes, El Salvador is now quite safe to visit! Just stay aware of your surroundings, like you would anywhere when traveling.
